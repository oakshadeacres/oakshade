          <p class="text-earth-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Oakshade Acres started with a simple love for animals and a desire to live closer to the land.
            What began as a few backyard chickens has grown into a small farm dedicated to raising healthy,
            happy animals in a natural environment.
          </p>
          <p class="text-earth-600 leading-relaxed">
            We believe that animals raised with care and respect produce the best results, whether that's
            fresh eggs from our hens or friendly goats that bring joy to families and homesteads.
